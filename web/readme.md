# Voce Moderna

https://projectvocemoderna.com

Voce Moderna is a new resource to help connect singers with contemporary opera arias. It is intended to showcase and promote the work of living composers, and focuses on works written since 2000.

Composers and publishers are collaborators with the project, and they receive royalties from track purchases. Mechanical licenses have been obtained so that these practice tracks could be made available for personal use.

Creators, operas, and arias will continue to be added to this site over time.
